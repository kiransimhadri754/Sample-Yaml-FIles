      summary: Financial Health Index (V1)
      description: "Financial Health Index is a single metric that summarises a customer’\
        s financial health based on current account transaction data. It uses open\
        \ banking technology to analyse a customer’s current account data in real\
        \ time and identify their likelihood of making credit repayments. The Index\
        \ (values 1- 9) ranks an individual's creditworthiness based on behaviours\
        \ and insights found in account information. Proven to be highly predictive\
        \ of credit risk, the FHI can be used in combination with traditional credit\
        \ scoring approaches to improve the assessment of creditworthiness by incorporating\
        \ insights from account information (income, salary, rental payments, council\
        \ tax payments, account surplus, etc.) for a more holistic risk assessment.\
        \ Transparent and explainable, alongside the FHI are supplied 26 credit risk\
        \ indicators that help explain why the individual has been assigned the index\
        \ value. Financial Health Index (V1) is based on amount of account information\
        \ requested, e.g. 3, 6 and 12 months of data."
